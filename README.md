python-snippets
===============

This repository contains small snippets of Python code and Python libraries which I have either written to serve a utility purpose or which I think serve as a nice example of some educational or other concept.

See the [Documentation](https://github.com/btrzcinski/python-snippets/tree/master/doc) for more details on each snippet.
