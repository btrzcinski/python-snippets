python-snippets
===============

This repository contains small snippets of Python code and Python libraries which I have either written to serve a utility purpose or which I think serve as a nice example of some educational or other concept.

See the [Documentation](http://btrzcinski.github.io/python-snippets) for module descriptions, APIs, and more.
